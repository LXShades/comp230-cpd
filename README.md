# Weekly Reports
## Ongoing thoughts
**We need to do more playtesting.** It's early days, and we haven't even selected a single final prototype yet, but the playtesting is vital based on my last experience.  
**Treat every sprint as a game jam.** Remember how much of Demiurge got done in the last week? Let's do that every week.  
**People are tired of meetings.** That's fine, as long as everyone's available at 5:15, we can keep everyone up-to-date.  
**Let's monitor attendance closely** so we can track productivity.  
**Any other productivity tracking techniques? Trello?**  
We need a third prototype pronto Tomas!  

## Week One (24th September)
It's good to be back! Society meetings and awkward encounters with other humans marked the continuation of my journey to not be on a totally different wavelength. Overall a good start!  

PASS sessions started the first time this week and I was nervous. My practice session in Week 0 made me aware of the difficulty in doing this alone, and I decided my initial role would be to:  

- **Facilitate friendship groups** in the cohort  
- **Clear up confusions** on the course  

In my first week, my biggest challenge was working with others. So inspired by another person in PASS training, I wrote up an icebreaker interview sheet. Included were questions such as your place on the alignment grid, and best Pokémon/Overwatch character.  

I paired them up and they interviewed each other. This was quite successful and conversations were flowing!  

Due to odd numbers, I participated in one of the interviews. This was fun, and I got to know Jakob a bit; however, it made it **more difficult to monitor everyone** and lead the session. Next time I'll avoid pairing myself up and make a **group of three** so I can **monitor everyone** and move around more freely.

## Week Two (1st October)
This week, we met our PO for the first time. My initial impression of him no-BS businessperson seemed to reactivate that portion of my brain that tries to make me look smart, which I call the Snape cortex. Fortunately, that part of my brain is small, and so is the rest of it too, so it didn't manifest significantly enough to worry my teammates.  

However, I did become concerned that **we aren't using the Agile process**. I brought this up as something the team should start doing, as workflow was becoming blurred: who is doing what? Who is everyone? I still can't remember everyone's names.  

This wasn't a massive concern, as we were still in the prototyping phase and ideas and plans changed rapidly. However, it would put me at ease to know what everyone is doing. It would also be beneficial to begin early on, so those who haven't done it before can get up to speed. I set my goal this next week to **start the Agile process**.  

## Week Three (8th October)
This week, I finally get to speak in present tense as I'm up-to-date with my CPD diary! How **are** you? I **am** fine thanks!  

Are we doing Agile yet? **Yes...kind of!** Choosing a stand-up time was a headache. There is no time **at a reasonable hour**, **early in the morning**, where **everyone is available**. Some **need to travel a long distance to arrive**, some **are in a different building**, and some **outright refuse to arrive at 8.45**. Emily's suggestion is to do evening stand-ups, which we're starting off with. The disadvantage of being super tired could be outweighed by the improved attendance and reduced pressure. I plan to **monitor the attendance register** just in case, though.  

**Time management. Prioritising. 10% marks. Comp210 essay.** These words spun in a vortex in my head. Hi Dorothy. I should just say 'oh, wait, **this essay** will give me **only 10% marks**, I could be **managing** my time to do **prioritise** something else'. To put myself at ease, I will **check my marks** as soon as I receive the results. If they **are a first** I can assure myself that I put in too much effort and can put in less next time.  

## Week Four (15th October)
Hi! This week has been successful so far. Among the things that went well was the develompent of a much nicer-looking paint prototype. Changing the colours to fit the tone, and adding some lights, while using an artist's assets made the prototype look more complete even though it was functionally not significantly changed. I will  keep doing that: add some quick and dirty building blocks to make the prototype more fun to play around in.  

On Thursday after a meeting, I was hit with a criticism from my teammate who urged me to stop micromanaging the team. I believe there was some truth in this. There is an irony in being told you micromanage too much, then reflecting deeply in a notably convoluted reflective journal, but it touches on what I feel is habitual of myself. In fact, my head already self-identified myself as an aspiring leader, without me really noticing, and I forgot that this is a leaderless team here.  

**We won't make a good game without autonomy.** Therefore, oops. 'Micromanaging' is a useful word. To break this habit down, I'm reading these two articles this evening:

## Week Five (22nd October)

## Week Six (29th October)

# Notes
### Dispositional domain:
Time management, motivation, self-discipline  

### Affective domain:  
Capacity to be aware of, control and express emotions, and how to handle situations in a judicous and empathetic way.  

### Interpersonal domain:
Communication, listening, negotiation, problem-solving, decision-making and assertiveness  
Not everyone has perfect interpersonal skills. The vital skill is managing all people including these kind.  

### Cognitive domain:
Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of your approach to learning.  

As I noticed in the study, one of these things is reflecting on progress. This is mildly ironic. And generally speaking, if there is any case of irony wherein I am the one to call it ironic, it is ironic.  

### Procedural domain:
Identifying the skills you have, and what you need to improve. There is a GDC talk called How to Succeed, Fail and Learn worth watching.

# Arising Problem Areas (Year 2 Study Block 1)
## Micromanaging
Thinking deeply about it, I've been too bossy. A team member mentioned this in a throwaway comment, and after a bit of googling, I'm guilty--my insecurities are leading me to give the team too little space.  

First port of call, as suggested in on a Harvard Business Review article [1], is to identify the cause of this. A list of symptoms is on the Process.st article [2]:  

* They don’t delegate  
* Any delegated work is taken over again if a mistake is spotted  
* **They hate decisions being made without them**  
* **Focus is on the little details rather than the big picture**  
* Most (or all) of their time is spent overseeing others  
* They ignore the opinion and/or experience of others  
* **Frequent updates are requested by them (even if the project isn’t relevant to them)**  
* **They often find deliverables unsatisfactory**  

I've bolded the ones apply to me, and hot darn, that is a lot of symptoms. Apparently, it goes in hand with perfectionism. An extremely familiar word as well. And I've built up perfectionism over the years... all the time, I've tried to do things the 'right' way, right down to 3DS Max licensing and making my own engines.  

I don't want to be this way. I'm too controlling - can't we all make our personal best work into one good game, not just achieve a single idea? I'm starting to visualise a team now where I can ask people, what can I do that isn't in the prototype yet? Someone raises their hand, says 'rune-based paint mechanic'. I say, 'that's a nice idea, but I don't think I can program it quickly'. **'What other ideas do you have?'**  

The big word is **autonomy**, we all need to have a part of the game. I can do my scrum stuff, then I can sit down and make some cool stuff. Heck, maybe sometimes, we could **throw away Agile altogether.** Make an 'anything goes' day, where we can make something cool that isn't necessarily in the books.  

A strategy to look into is **OKR**, or Objectives and Key Results [2], they could be broad enough for the team to be creative.  

Also refer back to when the **deadline was coming up for Demiurge**. A lot of stuff got done when we broke the flow.  

Anyway, it's too late in the night to think too much about this stuff. Here's the top three things I intend to do from now on:  

* Be a **good programmer**, not leader  
* Provide **positive reinforcement**. **No negatives until the milestones are reached**  
* **Trust the team**  

And a few more...   
* Relax: speak casually, stop feeding concerned minds.  
* If they talk to me about each other, tell them to talk to each other, not me  
* If it feels like I've been too close, go off into another part of the studio, be cool about it. **You guys do your thing, I'll be making some cool programming shit over there.** [3]  
* Tell them, feel free to ask me about programming stuff  
* Delegate tasks to the others  
* Maybe propose the milestones, but don't specify how they should be reached [3]  
* Be a good source of advice, not critique  
* **Autonomy**  

Next week:  
* **Make the scrum timetable public**  

Speaking of positive reinforcement, my mind's attacking itself quite hard right now. Let's ease it up. **It's fine to make a couple mistakes**. Learning from them is the important bit: consider this a good start. Excessive maybe, but I've also **encouraged the team to think a little**. They can **ask me for help** if they want to now, and I can ease off at the same time. Finally, I feel like I'm on a **positive stepping stone**, even if it's given me a heavy heart. Now, time to YouTube and sleep.

# Arising Problem Areas (Year 1 Study Block 2)
## Communication blocks
There are times when I know I need to know something, but don't ask. Things like 'why hasn't x updated the Trello board, and when will they?'.  

The cause is probably that deep childhood etc etc. If I talked too much, people tuned me out. However, I know this stuff is important. Chances are, they do too. So the important thing is to focus on their perspective: expose what they already knew. I could do this by, upon not seeing the Trello boards updated in the first thirty minutes, **asking them what they're currently doing**. When they answer, I'll acknowledge, say my thoughts, and then say **can you add that to the Trello board and stick your name on it?**.  

I probably need to read up on basic psychology to get it just right.  

## Lack of work/underachievement
I need to step back and look at the things that have slowed me down these past few weeks:  

**1. Dialogue system overscoping:** The dialogue system I was making had too many features. We really **need something on the screen**. Now that we're knee-deep into Unreal, I'll make sure I'm making something **presentable to the team** from now on.  
**2. Separate projects:** Oh man. Just **don't do them**. Keep it to one project next time.

# Achievements
## SVN
I've played a role in making sure everyone knows how SVN works. I made a channel in Slack, however I noticed **not many people read it**. There were many who **asked me how SVN works** despite all the information being there. I believe this is fine, perhaps just a lack of self-motivation on their part. Question is, **could I do more to encourage the team to read my tutorial(s)**?

## Hanging out
We really need to hang out more--I notice that we get to know each other best in **scenarios where we're not working**. And I feel it'd be great benefit to know each other, there's more motivation in pleasing people you know well than those you don't--not everyone is as **motivated by work as I am**, and furthermore that motivation very very much excludes Unreal.
