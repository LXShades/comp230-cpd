# Weekly Reports
## Ongoing thoughts
**We need to do more playtesting.** It's early days, and we haven't even selected a single final prototype yet, but the playtesting is vital based on my last experience.  
**Treat every sprint as a game jam.** Remember how much of Demiurge got done in the last week? Let's do that every week.  
**People are tired of meetings.** That's fine, as long as everyone's available at 5:15, we can keep everyone up-to-date.  
**Let's monitor attendance closely** so we can track productivity.  
**Any other productivity tracking techniques? Trello?**  
We need a third prototype pronto Tomas!  

## Week One (24th September)
It's good to be back! Society meetings and awkward encounters with other humans marked the continuation of my journey to not be on a totally different wavelength. Overall a good start!  

PASS sessions started the first time this week and I was nervous. My practice session in Week 0 made me aware of the difficulty in doing this alone, and I decided my initial role would be to:  

- **Facilitate friendship groups** in the cohort  
- **Clear up confusions** on the course  

In my first week, my biggest challenge was working with others. So inspired by another person in PASS training, I wrote up an icebreaker interview sheet. Included were questions such as your place on the alignment grid, and best Pokémon/Overwatch character.  

I paired them up and they interviewed each other. This was quite successful and conversations were flowing!  

Due to odd numbers, I participated in one of the interviews. This was fun, and I got to know Jakob a bit; however, it made it **more difficult to monitor everyone** and lead the session. Next time I'll avoid pairing myself up and make a **group of three** so I can **monitor everyone** and move around more freely.

## Week Two (1st October)
This week, we met our PO for the first time. My initial impression of him no-BS businessperson seemed to reactivate that portion of my brain that tries to make me look smart, which I call the Snape cortex. Fortunately, that part of my brain is small, and so is the rest of it too, so it didn't manifest significantly enough to worry my teammates.  

However, I did become concerned that **we aren't using the Agile process**. I brought this up as something the team should start doing, as workflow was becoming blurred: who is doing what? Who is everyone? I still can't remember everyone's names.  

This wasn't a massive concern, as we were still in the prototyping phase and ideas and plans changed rapidly. However, it would put me at ease to know what everyone is doing. It would also be beneficial to begin early on, so those who haven't done it before can get up to speed. I set my goal this next week to **start the Agile process**.  

## Week Three (8th October)
This week, I finally get to speak in present tense as I'm up-to-date with my CPD diary! How **are** you? I **am** fine thanks!  

Are we doing Agile yet? **Yes...kind of!** Choosing a stand-up time was a headache. There is no time **at a reasonable hour**, **early in the morning**, where **everyone is available**. Some **need to travel a long distance to arrive**, some **are in a different building**, and some **outright refuse to arrive at 8.45**. Emily's suggestion is to do evening stand-ups, which we're starting off with. The disadvantage of being super tired could be outweighed by the improved attendance and reduced pressure. I plan to **monitor the attendance register** just in case, though.  

**Time management. Prioritising. 10% marks. Comp210 essay.** These words spun in a vortex in my head. Hi Dorothy. I should just say 'oh, wait, **this essay** will give me **only 10% marks**, I could be **managing** my time to do **prioritise** something else'. To put myself at ease, I will **check my marks** as soon as I receive the results. If they **are a first** I can assure myself that I put in too much effort and can put in less next time.  

## Week Four (15th October)

## Week Five (22nd October)

## Week Six (29th October)

# Notes
### Dispositional domain:
Time management, motivation, self-discipline  

### Affective domain:  
Capacity to be aware of, control and express emotions, and how to handle situations in a judicous and empathetic way.  

### Interpersonal domain:
Communication, listening, negotiation, problem-solving, decision-making and assertiveness  
Not everyone has perfect interpersonal skills. The vital skill is managing all people including these kind.  

### Cognitive domain:
Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of your approach to learning.  

As I noticed in the study, one of these things is reflecting on progress. This is mildly ironic. And generally speaking, if there is any case of irony wherein I am the one to call it ironic, it is ironic.  

### Procedural domain:
Identifying the skills you have, and what you need to improve. There is a GDC talk called How to Succeed, Fail and Learn worth watching.

# Arising Problem Areas (Year 1 Study Block 2)
## Communication blocks
There are times when I know I need to know something, but don't ask. Things like 'why hasn't x updated the Trello board, and when will they?'.  

The cause is probably that deep childhood etc etc. If I talked too much, people tuned me out. However, I know this stuff is important. Chances are, they do too. So the important thing is to focus on their perspective: expose what they already knew. I could do this by, upon not seeing the Trello boards updated in the first thirty minutes, **asking them what they're currently doing**. When they answer, I'll acknowledge, say my thoughts, and then say **can you add that to the Trello board and stick your name on it?**.  

I probably need to read up on basic psychology to get it just right.  

## Lack of work/underachievement
I need to step back and look at the things that have slowed me down these past few weeks:  

**1. Dialogue system overscoping:** The dialogue system I was making had too many features. We really **need something on the screen**. Now that we're knee-deep into Unreal, I'll make sure I'm making something **presentable to the team** from now on.  
**2. Separate projects:** Oh man. Just **don't do them**. Keep it to one project next time.

# Achievements
## SVN
I've played a role in making sure everyone knows how SVN works. I made a channel in Slack, however I noticed **not many people read it**. There were many who **asked me how SVN works** despite all the information being there. I believe this is fine, perhaps just a lack of self-motivation on their part. Question is, **could I do more to encourage the team to read my tutorial(s)**?

## Hanging out
We really need to hang out more--I notice that we get to know each other best in **scenarios where we're not working**. And I feel it'd be great benefit to know each other, there's more motivation in pleasing people you know well than those you don't--not everyone is as **motivated by work as I am**, and furthermore that motivation very very much excludes Unreal.
